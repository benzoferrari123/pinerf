Gun Scripts
The script in here is used as the controller for the PiZero connected to the Gun. This script serves two functions: sending camera data to the base turret and receiving data from the turret to control the Gun.

This script creates a socket connection with the Turret Base which acts as a socket server. The camera connected to the PiZero is used and the incoming camera data is sent over this socket on a predefined port.

Once the turret base receives the camera data, it will perform any processing on the image and will respond with either a '0' (face not reconised) or a '1' (face recognised). This signal is used to either switch on or off a data pin on the PiZero which will turn on/off a transistor.

Additionally, incase the PiZero crashes, a pin is used for a reset signal so that the gun does not need to be opened to reset the microcontroller. The gun peforms no processing on the image.
