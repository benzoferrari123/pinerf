# Documentation for PiNerf Turret

## Objective

The primary objective of the turret is to provide a stablised support for the blaster such that the camera's facial regognition will remain unaffected by vibrations and movements of the system. To allow the blaster to fire in all directions, the turret system must provide freedom of rotation in two axes. Additionally, all parts of the mechanical design must be designed such that 3D printing is feasible and PLA plastic material will be strong enough to support the blaster. The final requirement is to have a connection to mains which can power both the Nerf blaster and camera.

## Design

The turret is held on two base plates of equal diameter connected by a flanged shaft which is screwed into the bottom base plate. Rotation around this shaft allows rotation in the x-y plane.

Two half-elipse shaped uprights are used to increase the z-height of the connection to the blaster to give space for the ammunition box. These feature screw holes on either end which connect them to the top base plate.

The primary rod fits between holes in the uprights, rotating in the x-z plane and thus giving the system full degree of freedom of rotation. The rod is fitted with a cap at either end to hold it in place.

Secondary rods are fixed onto either end of the primary rod by screws. These rods hold hollow boxes fitted to the ammunition box and trigger of the blaster to easily attach and remove it from the turret.

USB power line to the blaster's battery is reached through a hole cut into the bottom of the trigger which is held by the turret. The line terminates at a female USB connector located at the base plate.
